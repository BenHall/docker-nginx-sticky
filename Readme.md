####Â Nginx Sticky Docker Image

This is designed for use with [nginx-proxy sticky](https://github.com/benhall/nginx-proxy/tree/sticky)

Nginx compiled from source with the additional nginx-sticky-module. This allows you to load balance using cookies instead of IP. This is important if you want to load balance when traffic comes from a single source IP such as a conference or proxy.
